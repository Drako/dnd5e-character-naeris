## Background: [Magic scholar](character/background)

Naeris is a scholar of the mage academy in Evereska. It is tradition at that academy that a scholar spends his last 20 years before adulthood traveling the world seeking for knowledge and training his magic abilities. Therefore Naeris has already been traveling for 4 years now and coincidentally happens to meet our little group of adventurers. While an elf usually declares adulthood at approx. 100 years for scholars of the academy reaching adulthood is equivalent to becoming a master wizard. Thus after returning from her travels she will face an extremely difficult trial where she will have to utilize everything she learned so far.

Naeris is a descendent of an ancient gold elf (or sun elf) family purely consisting of mages. While her skills are by far not as powerful as those of her older brother she is extremely motivated to keep up with the high standards of her family. Her goal is to become one of the most powerful mages in history.

Her father Arannis is a member of the city council of Evereska and represents the interests of the magic community of the city, her mother Keyleth is a teacher at the mage's academy specialized in conjuration. They own a villa in the noble district and have several servants.

Her older brother Sai is 97 and as such has almost finished his travels but might still randomly be encountered by the heroes. His specialities are illusions and messing with the minds of his foes.

Like most elves the family follows the god Corellon Larethian.
