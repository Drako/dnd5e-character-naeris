# Burning Hands - 1st Level Evocation

* German name: Brennende HÃ¤nde
* Casting time: 1 action
* Range: Self, 15-foot (4.5m) cone
* Duration: Instantaneous
* Components: Voice, Somatic

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread,
a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips.
Each creature in a 15-foot (4.5m) cone must make a **Dexterity** saving throw.
A creature takes **3d6** fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher,
the damage increases by **1d6** for each slot above 1st.
